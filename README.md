# FTP Reader

### WARNING: THIS IS UNFINISHED AND MAY NOT FULLY WORK AT THIS TIME.

This module is designed to allow you to read files from an (S)FTP server easily
providing some functions to filter, sort, group and process the files found.

File contents when taken from the ftp server are returned as Buffer.

After processing, the files are moved to a folder of your choice.

### TODO

- Unit tests
- Add ability to have pre & post processing functions
- Change it to export either a class for repeated use, or just a function for
  one off use.

### Developer Setup

- npm install
